### About DESIGNATION:


Go to college if you want a degree. But come to DESIGNATION if you want a job. In 10 weeks, we'll teach you the fundamentals of digital design, including UX, UI, front-end web development and more. We believe the best way to learn something is to roll up your sleeves and start doing it. Thatâ€™s why we place a strong emphasis on practical skills in a creative, collaborative, immersive environment.
